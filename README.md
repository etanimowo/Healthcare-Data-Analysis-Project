## GitHub Repository Write-Up for Healthcare Data Analysis Project

## Project Title:

## Healthcare Data Analysis – Improving Patient Outcomes with Data

## Description:
This project analyzes hospital data to uncover trends in patient admissions, readmission rates, wait times, 
and risk factors such as blood pressure and glucose levels. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to 
optimize hospital operations and patient care.

## Key KPIs Analyzed:
✔ **Total Admissions** – Understanding hospital patient flow.
✔ ***Readmission Rate (%)** – Identifying trends in patient returns.
✔ **Average Wait Time** – Measuring hospital efficiency.
✔ **Average Length of Stay (LOS)** – Evaluating resource utilization.
✔ **Patient "At Risk" %** – Assessing high-risk cases (BP ≥ 130 mmHg, Glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL).

## Data Visualizations:
📌 **Glucose Level by Readmission Status Trend** – Identifying diabetes-related readmission risks.
📌 **Patient "At Risk" Analysis** – Percentage of high-risk patients.
📌 **Blood Pressure by Age Group** – Understanding hypertension trends.
📌 **Glucose Level Distribution** – Visualizing glucose variations.
📌 **Blood Pressure Status Trend** – Monitoring BP progression over time.

## Insights & Key Findings:
✔ Diabetic patients have higher readmission rates.
✔ Older patients are more prone to hypertension.
✔ Emergency admissions have longer wait times.

By leveraging data analytics, hospitals can reduce readmissions, optimize patient care, and improve resource allocation.
